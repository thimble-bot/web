# Privacy Policy

Thimble Bot is a Discord bot that aims to bring useful and fun commands to
Discord server members and moderators.
Our website is available at https://thimble-bot.vercel.app and is deployed on
[Vercel's][vercel-url] servers. The bot application runs on a
[Hetzner Virtual Private Server][hetzner-url]. This document describes when,
how, and what kind of data Thimble Bot collects about you.

## Website

The website does not collect any personal information about you and does not
place cookies on your computer. It's a static website that only communicates
with GitHub's servers. Please read [GitHub's Privacy Statement][github-privacy]
and [Vercel's Privacy Policy][vercel-privacy].

## Data Storage

We store certain publicly available information (such as user and guild IDs)
for commands that require them. For example, the interaction commands require
storing the guild ID in which certain interactions happen, as well as the
participants of said interactions. The data is stored on
[Firestore][firestore-url].

## Error Reporting

Thimble Bot will send error reports using [Sentry][sentry-url] in case of
unhandled exceptions. The information sent will be specific to the code (i.e.
the exact location of the errored code) and does not contain any personal
information.

## Changes

We reserve the right to change the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy
at any given moment without notification. The up-to-date version of this Privacy
Policy will always be available at https://thimble-bot.vercel.app/privacy.

## Consent

By using the services offered by Thimble Bot, you hereby consent to this Privacy
Policy and agree to its terms and conditions.
