# Privacy Policy

Thimble Bot is a Discord bot that aims to bring useful and fun commands to
Discord server members and moderators.
Our website is available at https://thimble-bot.vercel.app and is deployed on
[Vercel's][vercel-url] servers. The bot application runs on a
[Hetzner Virtual Private Server][hetzner-url]. This document describes when,
how, and what kind of data Thimble Bot collects about you.

## Data Storage

We store certain publicly available information (such as user and guild IDs)
for commands that require them. For example, the interaction commands require
storing the guild ID in which certain interactions happen, as well as the
participants of said interactions. The data is stored on
[Firestore][firestore-url].

## Error Reporting

Thimble Bot will send error reports using [Sentry][sentry-url] in case of
unhandled exceptions. The information sent will be specific to the code (i.e.
the exact location of the errored code) and does not contain any personal
information.

## Website

The Thimble Bot Website does not place any cookies on your computer by default.
The Website's "Dashboard" feature requires you to log in using your Discord
account, however we do not store **any** of the data exposed by the Discord API.
We **will** place cookies that are necessary for the authentication. Your
Discord access token never gets saved or exposed anywhere. When logging in, the
website receives your public Discord profile and the list of Discord servers
you're in.

When you save the configuration settings on the Website, your request will go
through multiple providers. We will first send the data and authenticate you
using a serverless function on Vercel. In that serverless function, we will send
a request to the Discord API to validate that you own the server on which you
want to change the bot application's settings. Once we validate your request, we
will save the data on a Firestore instance, as described earlier. This
information does not contain any private information about you or your Discord
access token.

In addition to the "Dashboard" feature of the website, we will also send a
request to GitHub to retrieve the list of commands supported by the bot
application.

## Changes

We reserve the right to change the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy
at any given moment without notification. The up-to-date version of this Privacy
Policy will always be available at https://thimble-bot.vercel.app/privacy.

## Consent

By using the services offered by Thimble Bot, you hereby consent to this Privacy
Policy and agree to its terms and conditions.
